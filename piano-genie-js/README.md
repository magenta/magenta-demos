# Piano Genie Demo

This directory formerly hosted our interactive demo for [Piano Genie](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie).

We now have a better demo available at [goo.gl/magenta/piano-genie](https://goo.gl/magenta/piano-genie). It was built with the Piano Genie model in [Magenta JS](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta-js/tree/master/music) and its source code is available on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/piano-genie).

If you are interested in our old demo which featured *all* of the models from our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05246), you can still find it [here](https://chrisdonahue.github.io/piano-genie-research-demo/) ([code](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/piano-genie-research-demo/)).
