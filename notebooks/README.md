# Jupyter Notebook Demonstrations

This directory contains [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
notebook demos of some Magenta models. Jupyter should have alreadd been installed
as part of Magenta. If not, see the Jupyter
[installation instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks can be viewed by clicking on the links below.  To use them
interactively, run the command ``jupyter notebook`` from the
``magenta-demos/notebooks`` directory of your magenta-demos install.
This will launch Jupyter in your browser.


Available notebooks include

* **Exploring Neural Audio Synthesis with NSynth**: [Exploring_Neural_Audio_Synthesis_with_NSynth.ipynb](/notebooks/Exploring_Neural_Audio_Synthesis_with_NSynth.ipynb)
* **Performance RNN**: [Performance_RNN.ipynb](/notebooks/Performance_RNN.ipynb)
