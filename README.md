# Magenta Demos

This repository contains various demonstrations of [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org) models.
For the Magenta library and models, see our [main repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta).

* [**AI Duet**](/ai-duet): A browser-based piano that responds to,
demonstrating a Magenta note sequence generation model. Built by
[Yotam Mann](https://github.com/tambien) with friends on the Magenta and
Creative Lab teams at Google. A hosted version is available as an
[AI Experiment](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/ai-duet).
* [**AI Jam (Ableton)**](/ai-jam-ableton): A demonstration of several
Magenta note sequence generation models originally developed as a demonstration
for NIPS 2016. Requires an installation of Ableton Live and MaxForLive. You can
watch a video of this demo in action on our
[blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/12/16/nips-demo/).
* [**AI Jam (JavaScript)**](/ai-jam-js): A demonstration that combines
much of the functionality of the AI Jam demo with the browser-based interface
of the AI Duet demo. Can be set up much more easily than the Ableton version.
* [**Jupyter Notebooks**](/jupyter-notebooks): Jupyter notebooks for all Magenta projects.
* [**NSynth**](/nsynth): Two demonstrations of our neural audio synthesis
method.
* [**Sketch-RNN**](/sketch-rnn-js): A JavaScript implementation of our Sketch-RNN algorithm, along with 100 pre-trained models.
