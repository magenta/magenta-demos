# Jupyter Notebook Demonstrations

This directory contains [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
notebook demos of some Magenta models. Jupyter should have already been installed
as part of Magenta. If not, see the Jupyter
[installation instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks can be viewed by clicking on the links above.  To use them
interactively, run the command ``jupyter notebook`` from the
``/jupyter-notebooks`` directory of your magenta-demos install.
This will launch Jupyter in your browser.
