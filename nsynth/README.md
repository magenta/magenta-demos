# NSynth

In a [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/nsynth-instrument), we describe the details of NSynth (Neural Audio Synthesis), a new approach to audio synthesis using neural networks.

There are three main ways to use NSynth:

* An interactive [AI Experiment](https://g.co/soundmaker) made in collaboration with Google Creative Lab that lets you interpolate between pairs of instruments to create new sounds.

* A MaxForLive Device that integrates into both [Max MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/). It allows you to explore the space of NSynth sounds through an intuitive grid interface. [[<b>DOWNLOAD</b>]](http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/demos/nsynth/NSynthProject.zip)

* Create your own audio samples with the [pretrained network](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/nsynth).

See also the Jupyter notebook for NSynth in the [/notebooks](/notebooks)
directory.
